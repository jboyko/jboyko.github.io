I".<p>I used to obsessively watch the Simpsons and nature documentaries. On family vacations to Orlando, while my parents and sister lounged by the pool working on their tans, I ran around trying to catch brown anoles. Theyâ€™d come home with the nicer tan, but I was eventually paid to catch anoles.</p>
