              <p>I used to obsessively watch the Simpsons and nature documentaries. On family vacations to Orlando, while my parents and sister lounged by the pool working on their tans, I ran around trying to catch brown anoles. They’d come home with the nicer tan, but I was eventually paid to catch anoles.</p>

              <p>It took time to realize where my passions lay, but along the way I met wonderful people and learned about diverse subjects in history, music, philosophy, and biology. I was very fortunate to be apart of three different labs during my time at U of T. My responsibilities ranged from dishwasher to research student, but at every stage I was exposed to interesting ecological and evolutionary ideas.</p>

              <p>My MSc was an invaluable learning experience, I will forever be grateful for this opportunity that gained me many intangible skills and ethics. And so, if I have any writing ability at all, Luke may take credit, but in doing so he accepts responsibility for my spelling ability as well.</p>

              <p>I’m very excited to be working with Jeremy on a wide range of projects. We share a need to question the status quo and I’m very fortunate to have wonderful lab mates who put up with it. I’m enjoying the PhD thus far and am looking forward to putting the skills I’ve gained over the years to good use.</p>
