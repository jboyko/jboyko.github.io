I"<<p>I’m very excited to be working with Jeremy on a wide range of projects. We share a need to question the status quo and I’m very fortunate to have wonderful lab mates who put up with it. I’m enjoying the PhD thus far and am looking forward to putting the skills I’ve gained over the years to good use.</p>
