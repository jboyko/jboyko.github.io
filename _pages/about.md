I'm a PhD student at the University of Arkansas working with Dr. Jeremy Beaulieu.  I completed my MSc in 2016 with Dr. Luke Mahler at the Univerity of Toronto. Back then I was studying Anolis lizards and the early stages of adaptive radiation (and a little bit about Anolis sexual dimorphism). My other hobbies are cartoon animation, taking care of my chickens and garden, playing dotes, and a constant battle with alcoholism (it's part of the job).
