    title: "I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada"
    excerpt: I used to obsessively watch the Simpsons and nature documentaries. On family vacations to Orlando, while my parents and sister lounged by the pool working on their tans, I ran around trying to catch brown anoles. They'd come home with the nicer tan, but I was eventually paid to catch anoles.

    title: "I got my MSc with Dr. Luke Mahler at the University of Toronto"
    excerpt: My MSc was an invaluable learning experience, I will forever be grateful for this opportunity that gained me many intangible skills and ethics. And so, if I have any writing ability at all, Luke may take credit, but in doing so he accepts responsibility for my spelling ability as well.

I'm enjoying the PhD thus far and am looking forward to putting the skills I've gained over the years to good use.
