    title: "I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada"
    excerpt: There are two things I've always loved: the Simpsons and nature documentaries. The Simpsons taught me everything I know about pop culture. Nature documentaries taught me to say "crikey" with an Australian accent. I remember when I was younger, on family vacations to Orlando, my parents and sister would lounge by the pool while I ran around trying to catch brown anoles. I admit, they'd come home with the nicer tan, but I was eventually paid to catch anoles.

    title: "I got my BSc at the University of Toronto in Human Biology and History"
    excerpt: It took time to realize where my passions lay, but along the way I met wonderful people and learned about diverse subjects in history, music, philosophy, and biology. I was very fortunate to be a part of three different labs during my undergraduate time at U of T. My responsibilities ranged from dishwasher to research student, but at every stage I was exposed to interesting ecological and evolutionary ideas.

    excerpt: My MSc was an invaluable learning experience and I will forever be grateful for this opportunity. I'm lucky to have had two fantastic mentors in Luke and Luke. I credit my writing ability to Luke, my coding ability to Luke, and my spelling to both.

    title: "I'm working on a PhD with Dr. Jeremey Beaulieu at the University of Arkansas"
    excerpt: I'm very excited to be working with Jeremy on a wide range of projects. We share a need to question the status quo and I'm very fortunate to have wonderful lab mates who put up with it. I'm enjoying the PhD thus far and am looking forward to putting the skills I've gained over the years to good use.
