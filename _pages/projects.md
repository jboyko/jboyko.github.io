    title: "Reconstructing the habitat of the first photosynthetic eukaryote"
    excerpt: The evolution of photosynthetic bacteria remains, perhaps, the most significant event in life's history, changing the flow of energy through the biosphere and the geology of earth itself.  Similarly, the evolution of autotrophic eukaryotes has proven critical to the development of terrestrial life.  Although the environmental conditions during the course of primary plastid endosymbiosis have recently been examined using phylogenetic comparative techniques, previous attempts to address these questions have relied exclusively on an exemplar sampling approach of cyanobacteria and early photosynthetic eukaryotes. At best, it remains unclear whether key events such as the primary endosymbiosis of the chloroplast occurred in low salinity (i.e., freshwater) habitat or in a marine environment, prolonging the debate about the ecological context for the origin of plastids. We have compiled an extensive dataset of over 85,000 species for which their salinity environment is known and combine this information with an additional character that defines whether the lineage was terrestrial or aquatic. We apply HiSSE models that account for both diversification rate differences in the coordinated evolution of multiple binary characters, as well as unmeasured factors that influence the rates of evolution in the observed characters. Additionally, we conduct a series of tests to examine whether the inherent “memory-less” processes underlying essentially all phylogenetically-based comparative frameworks applied solely to extant taxa naturally make it impossible to ever confidently infer ancestral conditions for an event that took place nearly 2.5 billions of years in the past.

    title: "Character displacement in Lesser Antillean Anolis"
    excerpt: Competition was the protagonist of On the Origin of Species and its significance to evolutionary theory has not waned. Where individuals strive to acquire the same limited non-substitutable resources, competition must exist. One possible outcome of an interaction between two species which share limited resources is phenotypic divergence in a manner that lessens competition. The process by which interspecific competition leads to phenotypic divergence was first formalized by Brown and Wilson (1956) and is termed character displacement. In this study we utilize the Lesser Antillean Anolis lizards to examine how ecological character displacement can influence the long-term evolutionary trajectories of sympatric anoles. Most models of character displacement combine a genetic model of phenotypic change and an ecological model that describes the interactions between species (Dayan and Simberloff, 2005). We use an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to model these conditions on a macroevolutionary scale. In an OU model, trait evolution can be influenced by specific external conditions through an evolutionary attraction towards specific fitness optima along the branches of a phylogeny (Beaulieu et al., 2012; Butler and King, 2004; Hansen, 1997). Although we are interested in which model best explains our dataset, model averaged parameters can shed light on the details of the process (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).

    title: "I'm working on a PhD with Dr. Jeremey Beaulieu at the University of Arkansas"
    excerpt: I'm very excited to be working with Jeremy on a wide range of projects. We share a need to question the status quo and I'm very fortunate to have wonderful lab mates who put up with it. I'm enjoying the PhD thus far and am looking forward to putting the skills I've gained over the years to good use.
