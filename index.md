# Welcome

Hello! I am James Boyko, a comparative biologist at the University of Michigan. 

My research focuses on studying phenotypic evolution on a macroevolutionary scale - typically by applying or developing phylogenetic comparative methods. More recently, I've been interested in applying deep neural networks to understand phenotypic evoluion for high-dimensional and non-standard data types. 

Feel free to explore my [Research](./research/), [Vignettes](./vignettes/), and [CV](./cv.pdf).
